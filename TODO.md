# TODO

## Bugs

- Block some operations until background load complete: Live Video, DB Update, Map

## Notes

PiGallery uses private branches of following public distributions due to following issues:

- FaceAPI: SSD/MobileNet model not compatible with TFJS@2.0+  
  <https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/issues/633>
- TensorFlow/JS: bug with WeakMap deallocation  
  <https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/3823>

## Future Features

- User DB management client-side
- User DB check server-side
- Move compare to main app as test feature
- Body pose for video
- Change build process to prepackage all external scripts
- Server-side processing using TFJS-Node: nVidia CUDA on WSL2 requires kernel 4.19.121 current 4.19.104
